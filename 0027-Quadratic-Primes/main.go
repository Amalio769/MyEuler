// Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
// 𝑛2 +𝑛 +41
// It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 ≤𝑛 ≤39.
// However, when 𝑛 =40,402 +40 +41 =40⁢(40 +1) +41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when 𝑛 =41,412 +41 +41 is
// clearly divisible by 41.
//
// The incredible formula 𝑛2 −79⁢𝑛 +1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0 ≤𝑛 ≤79.
// The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
//
// Considering quadratics of the form:
//
// 𝑛2 +𝑎⁢𝑛 +𝑏, where |𝑎| <1000 and |𝑏| ≤1000
//
// where |𝑛| is the modulus/absolute value of 𝑛
// e.g. |11| =11 and |−4| =4
// Find the product of the coefficients, 𝑎 and 𝑏, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes
// for consecutive values of 𝑛, starting with 𝑛 =0.
